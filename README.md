## **Hi there 👋**
My name is Kelvin Mwiti Muriithi. I am a generalist software engineer, and DevOps engineer. I combine my knowledge of software and data science to build data driven products that can solve problems and derive insights from the customers and developers. A considerable amount of my time is spent doing unpaid community work on things that I hope will help humanity in some way and my open source work is supported by the community.


Strong Languages: JavaScript, Python and PHP
